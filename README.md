# Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in machine learning (ML) pipelines. It involves transforming raw data into a format suitable for ML models to better understand and extract patterns. Here are some common techniques used in data preprocessing:

Handling Missing Data: Missing data can adversely affect model performance. Common strategies include removing rows with missing values, filling missing values with a placeholder (e.g., mean, median, mode), or using more advanced techniques such as interpolation or imputation.

Data Cleaning: This involves removing noise and inconsistencies from the data. It may include tasks like correcting typos, standardizing text (e.g., converting to lowercase), and removing duplicate records.

Feature Scaling: Features often have different scales, which can cause issues for certain ML algorithms. Techniques such as Min-Max scaling or standardization (z-score normalization) can be applied to scale features to a similar range.

Feature Encoding: Categorical variables need to be encoded into numerical format before feeding them into ML algorithms. Common encoding techniques include one-hot encoding, label encoding, and binary encoding.
